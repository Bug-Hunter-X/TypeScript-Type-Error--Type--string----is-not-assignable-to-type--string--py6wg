This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where an array of strings is passed to a function expecting a single string.  The error message is clear: 'Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.  This example shows how to fix this using type guards and other techniques.  The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.
